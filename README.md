# TensorFlow-Implementations

This repository contains the projects I have done with TensorFlow, and includes a few tutorials.

Use nbviewer for easy viewing and downloading.

- Custom Training Loop: Converts a simple Keras model.fit into an expanded customizable training loop using GradientTape. Includes graph plotting and model visualization utilities. 
- Text Generation: Compares RNN vs a Markov Chain method to generate text. Surprisingly, both are around the same, just by using like n=5 previous characters to predict the next one for the Markov Chain method.
